 The origin of our mandelbulb equations:
 * Mandelbulb.pbk
 * Last update: 14 December 2009
 *
 * Changelog:
 *		1.0		- Initial release
 *		1.0.1	- Fixed a missing asymmetry thanks to Chris King (http://www.dhushara.com)
 *				- Refinements in the colouring
 *      1.0.2   - Added radiolaria option for a funky hair-like effect
 * 				- Incorporated the scalar derivative method as described here:
 *			    - http://www.fractalforums.com/mandelbulb-implementation/realtime-renderingoptimisations/
 *		1.0.3	- Created a quick version of the script as using a boolean flag to determine
 *				  which distance estimation method created long compilation times.
 * 		1.0.4 	- Fixed issue with older graphic cards and the specular highlights
